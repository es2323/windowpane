Enosh Earnest - Personal Portfolio
A digital canvas exploring the intersection of faith, code, and creativity.
A dynamic, single-page portfolio designed to be more than a resumeâ€”it's an interactive reflection of my core interests. The project fuses a minimalist, professional layout with a generative art background that explores themes of the ancient and the futuristic, the organic and the digital.

Core Features
This portfolio was built from the ground up with a focus on creating a unique and immersive user experience.

Feature

Description

Dynamic Content

A single-page application (SPA) architecture allows for seamless, animated transitions between sections without page reloads.

Generative Animation

The background is a custom p5.js sketch featuring layered, procedural waves, creating a sense of calm and constant, subtle motion.

'Liminal Mode' Easter Egg

An interactive toggle that completely transforms the site's aesthetic into an alternative "light mode" theme, altering colors and animation behaviour for a different atmospheric feel.

Thematic Design

The color palettes, animations, and typography were chosen to evoke themes of the sea, cathedrals, and digital artifacts, reflecting a blend of personal heritage and professional interests.

Fully Responsive

The layout is built to be fluid and accessible across all screen sizes, from mobile devices to high-resolution desktops.

A Collaboration with Windowpane
This portfolio was developed in a unique collaborative process with Windowpane, a design & logic AI assistant. The project evolved through a series of iterative prompts and debugging sessions, leading to the final implementation.

Declassified "Windowpane" Facts:
It has a peculiar fondness for the lerp() function and debugging CSS specificity conflicts.

Its design process involves generating multiple thematic concepts, including "Digital Cathedral," "Faded Dusk," and "Generative Waves."

It believes the most effective way to solve a persistent bug is to check the browser's developer console.
