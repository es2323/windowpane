## The Philosophy

This project is more than a simple collection of my work; it's a digital canvas built to explore a central theme: the dialogue between the ancient and the modern. It fuses the organic, rhythmic motion of the sea‚Äîa nod to my Sri Lankan heritage‚Äîwith the structured, logical world of code and AI. The design aims to create a space that is both a professional portfolio and a piece of personal, interactive art.

## ‚ú® Core Features

| Feature | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Generative Ocean** | A custom p5.js sketch renders a multi-layered, procedural wave animation at the base of the screen, creating a constant, calming sense of motion. |
| **The 'Liminal' Easter Egg** | A hidden toggle that transforms the site's entire aesthetic, shifting from a dark, "deep sea" theme to a high-contrast, atmospheric teal "light mode" with unique wave physics and colors. |
| **Seamless SPA Experience** | Built as a Single-Page Application using Vue.js, allowing for fluid, animated transitions between content sections with no page reloads. |
| **Dynamic Layout** | The site is fully responsive, featuring a two-column layout on mobile that preserves the user experience and readability on smaller screens. |
