A dynamic, single-page portfolio designed to be more than a resumeâ€”it's an interactive reflection of my core interests. The project fuses a minimalist, professional layout with a generative art background that explores themes of the ancient and the futuristic, the organic and the digital.

## Core Features

This portfolio was built from the ground up with a focus on creating a unique and immersive user experience.

| Feature                 | Description                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic Content** | A single-page application (SPA) architecture allows for seamless, animated transitions between sections without page reloads.             |
| **Generative Animation**| The background is a custom p5.js sketch featuring layered, procedural waves, creating a sense of calm and constant, subtle motion.      |
| **'Liminal Mode' Easter Egg** | An interactive toggle that completely transforms the site's aesthetic into an alternative theme, altering colors and animation behaviour. |
| **Thematic Design** | The color palettes, animations, and typography were chosen to evoke themes of the sea, cathedrals, and digital artifacts.                 |
| **Fully Responsive** | The layout is built to be fluid and accessible across all screen sizes, from mobile devices to high-resolution desktops.                 |
